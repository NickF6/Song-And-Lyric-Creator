# Song-And-Lyric-Creator - Summary
This is a song and lyric creator. I built upon a starter product to develop the client side interface with React an GraphQL contained in the client folder.

## Requirements
1. Node must be install.
2. A mongoDB database is required to support the application. Please follow the instructions titled "Getting started with Atlas". You will need to complete parts 1-5 of the tutorial. In part 5 scroll down and only follow the instructions under "Connect to Your Atlas Cluster". Copy the "connection string".

## Running the project 
1. Clone the repository
2. Find the server.js file under the server folder. Edit the MONGO_URI with the connection string. Replace the username, database password, and database name in the string.
3. Locate the folder with the command line:
4. run npm install
5. run npm run dev
