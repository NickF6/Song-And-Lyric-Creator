# Song-And-Lyric-Creator - Summary
This is a song and lyric creator. I built upon a starter product to develop the client side interface with React an GraphQL contained in the client folder.

## Requirements and Setup

2. A mongoDB database must be connected to run the application. Please follow the instructions titled "Getting started with Atlas": https://docs.atlas.mongodb.com/getting-started. You will need to complete parts 1-5 of the guide. In part 5 scroll down and only follow the instructions under "Connect to Your Atlas Cluster". Copy the "connection string".

2. Locate the folder with the command line.
3. Find the server.js file under the server folder. Edit the MONGO_URI with the connection string. Replace the username, database password, and database name with those used in the MongoDB setup.
4. Change directory: cd Song-And-Lyric-Creator
4. Run: npm install
